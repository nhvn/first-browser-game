# first-browser-game

This game is inspired by the original game 'Flappy Bird' where your main objective is to dodge barriers to get as far as you can. However, there's a twist - there is an actual destination in this game. The idea for this game was born out of nostalgic memories of simpler times when games were less complex.

**Note:** This game is optimized for Windows. It is fully functional on Mac as well, but the sensitivity is incorrect, which makes the game unplayable. It has been tested on both platforms.

This project is my first milestone project from my bootcamp program, and I am proud of what I've accomplished so far. This is a JavaScript browser game built with HTML. I created this project around Halloween, so I decided to make it Halloween-themed. I designed some elements of the game from scratch, like the "black barriers" that players should avoid touching, or they lose. The game has room for improvement, but considering my knowledge at the time, I think it's awesome. Please feel free to try it out if you dare. It is a challenging game, so don't hesitate to give it multiple attempts.

## Getting Started

To start the game, you need to have the "Live Server" extension installed on your Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Then, run the project on a live server.

## Known Issues

- The character idling animation is just the character standing completely still.

## Future Improvements

- Add a menu bar.
- Add settings for languages.
- Include a "Game Over" prompt, allowing players to choose whether to restart or not, instead of automatically starting over.

If I had more time, I would definitely add these features and further enhance the game's functionality.
