# First Browser Game

This game takes inspiration from the classic game 'Flappy Bird', where the main objective is to dodge barriers and travel as far as possible. However, our game adds a twist - there's an actual destination to reach. You play as Jerry, on a mission to save his beloved pumpkin lost in the shadows. Your job is to navigate through the barriers with skill and precision to rescue the pumpkin. But beware, danger lurks behind you. This game was born out of a love for the simplicity and nostalgia of classic games.

**Note:** This game is optimized for Windows. It is fully functional on Mac as well, but the sensitivity is incorrect, which makes the game unplayable. It has been tested on both platforms.

This project is my first milestone project from my bootcamp program, and I am proud of what I've accomplished so far. This is a JavaScript browser game built with HTML and CSS. I created this project around Halloween, so I decided to make it Halloween-themed. I designed some elements of the game from scratch, like the "black barriers" that players should avoid touching, or they lose. The game has room for improvement, but considering my knowledge at the time, I think it's awesome. Please feel free to try it out if you dare. It is a challenging game, so don't hesitate to give it multiple attempts.
